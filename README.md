flowMC is a JAX-based Python package for normalizing-flow enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The code is open source under the MIT license and is under active development.

flowMC implements methods described in [Gabrié et al. (2021)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=mvtooHbjOwx) and [Gabrié et al. (2022)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2109420119). See the accompanying paper, [Wong, Gabrié, Foreman-Mackey (2023)](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05021), for more details.

- Just-in-time compilation support
- Native GPU acceleration
- Effective for multi-modal problems
- Minimal hyperparameter tuning required

## Installation

The simplest way to install flowMC is through pip:

```bash
pip install flowMC
```

This will install the latest stable release and its dependencies.
flowMC is built on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox).
By default, this installs the CPU version of JAX from [PyPI](https://pypi.org).
If you have a GPU and want to leverage hardware acceleration, install the CUDA-enabled version:

```bash
pip install flowMC[cuda]
```

If you want to install the latest version of flowMC, you can clone this repo and install it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GW-JAX-Team/flowMC.git
cd flowMC
pip install -e .
```

Additional optional dependencies are available:

- `flowMC[docs]`: Documentation dependencies
- `flowMC[visualize]`: Visualization dependencies

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python environment. After cloning the repository, run `uv sync` to create a virtual environment with all dependencies installed.
