flowMC is a JAX-based package for normalizing-flow-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. By using normalizing flows as a global proposal, flowMC accelerates convergence for multi-modal and high-dimensional posteriors while running natively on GPU with minimal hyperparameter tuning.

For a quick introduction, see the [Quick Start guide](https://flowmc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart/).

> [!WARNING]
> flowMC has not yet reached v1.0.0 and the API may change. Use at your own risk. Consider pinning to a specific version if you need API stability.

## Installation

The simplest way to install flowMC is through pip:

```bash
pip install flowMC
```

This will install the latest stable release and its dependencies.
flowMC is built on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).
By default, this installs the CPU version of JAX.
If you have an NVIDIA GPU, install the CUDA-enabled version:

```bash
pip install flowMC[cuda]
```

If you want to install the latest version of flowMC, you can clone this repo and install it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GW-JAX-Team/flowMC.git
cd flowMC
pip install -e .
```

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python environment. After cloning the repository, run `uv sync` to create a virtual environment with all dependencies installed.
